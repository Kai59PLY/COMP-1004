TITLE: Password Management System 

Project Vision: 

I will create a program that aims to assist the user in creating and managing their passwords which will then be stored locally in the browser and is able to be exported in a JSON file. The program will have requirements for the user's password such as special characters, capital letters and numbers to ensure the user has a sufficiently secure password as well as a strength rating to give the user an idea of the kind of security they can expect. Additionally the program will feature a password generator focused on creating complex and hard to crack passwords featuring special characters, numbers and capital letters.
